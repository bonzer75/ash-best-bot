### What is this?
Ash is my first discord bot called "ash", i maked it when i was learning how to program, i used nodejs and discordjs on this bot.
This project is currently not being maintained, it will probably be archived in the future.

**WARING:** Some comands doesn't work on discordjs v13, if u want to help me thanks u some much i have no time to make an upgrade xd

### Features 
- Roleplay commands
- Music commands cause rythm and groov are dead 
- A lot of memes
- A very cool staff

### Building
I used Node v14.19.0 LTS, make sure to use the right versuion.
To install de packages use this command:

`$ npm i`

**NOTE:** Some commands use zeew but don't download it, those commands doesn't work.

___I hope you love it so much as i do, it's very nostalgic for me :'D___

### Docker build
You can also use docker if you want to run the app on a server or use a container to develop.

Use this command to create the image.
`$ docker build -t my-app .`

And this to run the image.
`$ docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app`
