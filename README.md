### What is this?
Ash is my first discord bot called "ash", i maked it when i was learning how to program, i used nodejs and discordjs on this bot.
This project is currently not being maintained, it will probably be archived in the future.

**WARING:** Some comands doesn't work on discordjs v13, if u want to help me thanks u some much i have no time to make an upgrade xd

### Features 
- Roleplay commands
- Music commands cause rythm and groov are dead 
- A lot of memes
- A very cool staff

I used Node v14.19.0 LTS and another packages, you can download it with this commands:

`$ npm i discord.js@12.5.3`

`$ npm i star-labs`

`$ npm i reddit-fetch`

`$ npm i nekos.life`

**NOTE:** Some commands use zeew but don't download it, those commands doesn't work.
