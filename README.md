### What is this?
this is my old discord bot called "ash", i maked it when i was learning how to program, i used nodejs and discordjs on this bot.

**WARING:** Some comands could not work on the last version of discordjs, if u want to help me thanks u some much i have no time to make an upgrade xd

### Features 
- Roleplay commands
- Music commands cause rythm and groov are dead 
- A lot of memes
- A very cool staff

### Building
I used 1.14.17.6 LTS and another packages, you can download it with this commands:

`$ npm i discord.js@12.5.3`

`$ npm i star-labs`

`$ npm i reddit-fetch`

`$ npm i nekos.life`

**NOTE:** Some commands use zeew but don't download it, those commands don't work.

___I hope you love it so much as i do, it's very nostalgic for me :'D___
